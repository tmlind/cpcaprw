READ AND WRITE CPCAP PMIC REGISTERS ON ANDROID DEVICES

This utility allows easily reading and writing the CPCAP PMIC registers
when booted to the Android kernel. The Motorola custom CPCAP PMIC is used
on various Motorola phones and tablets such as droid 4.

Note that it currently only supports the mainline kernel regmap suitable
registers offsets as listed in motorola-cpcap.h and not the Motorola
mapphone Linux kernel register index.

To build and use:

1.  fetch the android NDK from https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html
2.  extract
3.  run make_standalone_toolchain.py --arch arm --force --api 21 --stl gnustl --install-dir=$(SOME_PATH)
4.  export CROSS_COMPILE=$(SOME_PATH)/binary
5.  make
6.  adb push cpcaprw /sdcard
7.  adb shell
8.  su
9.  mount -o rw,remount /system/bin
10. cp/sdcard/cpcaprw /system/bin/
11. cpcaprw 0x0048 # read CPCAP_REG_VERSC1
12. CPCAP register18 0x0048=0x0013

For write access, you probably need to modify the selinux permissions
for /dev/cpcap with chcon or something similar.

And note that to use the binary with most Android kernels, the compiler
must be armel and not armhf.

To see the cpcap registers with the mainline kernel, just do:

# cat /sys/kernel/debug/regmap/spi0.0/registers
